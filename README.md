# UpGrad-Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Problem Statement:
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. They provide a form for the potential customers posted on various websites and search engines like google, etc. 
These people (leads) are then contacted by the company employees to be guide, informed about the different courses available on the platform through mails, calls, and other mediums and converted into course takers. The lead conversion rate for X Education is around 30% and they want to increase this using logistic regression to get “Hot Leads” (leads with high chance of conversion).
If they are successful in doing so their sales would increase by huge margins and simultaneously save a lot of resources by minimizing on expenses as they’d know what to put their focus on exactly. They require a Lead Score assigned to each lead to between 0 and 100 to show their likelihood to become a permanent customer. 

Business Objective:
The company wants us to build a binary logistic regression which will predict potential ‘Hot Leads’ so they can convert them into customers.
They aim to improve the conversion rate to around 80% after the model development and deployment.
They would also like to know when they can reallocate their resources to save on employee working hours and other kinds of expenses.
